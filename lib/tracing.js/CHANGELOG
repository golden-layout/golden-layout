Tracing.js (1.2.0)
	2013-06-11 Francisco Soto <ebobby@ebobby.org>
	I think it justifies a significant version bump by now.
	* Simplified the stringify function, it was a mess.

Tracing.js (1.1.3)
	2013-06-09 Francisco Soto <ebobby@ebobby.org>
	* Added an object pretty printer function that will properly display NaN and functions.
	* Added some function header comments.

Tracing.js (1.1.2)
	2013-06-02 Francisco Soto <ebobby@ebobby.org>
	*Removed isEmpty, was used only once and I "empty" is usually related to other stuff as well, like empty arrays or strings.

Tracing.js (1.1.1)
	2013-06-02 Francisco Soto <ebobby@ebobby.org>
	* Fixed a bug when restoring the prototype of traced functions.

Tracing.js (1.1.0)
	2013-06-01 Francisco Soto <ebobby@ebobby.org>
	* arguments2array now uses Array.prototype.slice()
	* Tracing methods now return Tracing itself so calls can be chained.

Tracing.js (1.0.1)
	2013-05-16 Francisco Soto <ebobby@ebobby.org>
	* Made trace functions use JSON.stringify on parameters and return value so tracing output is a little bit more usable.

Tracing.js (1.0.0) ; initial release
