Golden Layout is a Javascript layout manager which enables you to layout components in a web page and re-arrange them with drag and drop.

**Important Note:** This is the main Golden Layout website. Another Golden Layout website is [https://golden-layout.com](https://golden-layout.com). This other website describes Version 1 of Golden Layout. The information at [https://golden-layout.com](https://golden-layout.com) may be useful to gain an initial understanding of Golden Layout however please note that it is now out of date.

# Installation / Usage

## Library
Golden Layout is shipped via NPM. Use the following commands to install it into an application package:\
`npm i golden-layout`

## Source
The source can be installed by cloning the repository at:\
`https://github.com/golden-layout/golden-layout`

To build the distribution locally, open a shell at the golden-layout directory/folder and run the following commands:
1. `npm install` or `npm ci` (recommended) to install required dependencies
1. `npm run build` to generate the distribution (`dist` subfolder). This script will:
    * delete the existing `lib` and `dist` folders
    * compile the TypeScript code
    * generate the rolled up TypeScript definition files (`index.d.ts` and `golden-layout-untrimmed.d.ts`)
    * generate source map
    * copy the style files to the `dist` folder

Note that the `lib` subfolder only holds the TypeScript declaration files generated by the compiler. Generally this subfolder can be ignored. It is used during the build process to generate the rolled up TypeScript definition files.

## Build and run demo/test app

After installing the source and building the distribution, you can build and start the `apitest` (demo) app to view the library in action. Use the following commands:
* `npm run apitest:build` to just build it
* `npm run apitest:serve` to both build and start the development server.\
You can then view it in your browser using the following link:\
http://localhost:3000/

## Building single-file bundles

We provide different types of single file bundles for easier consumption without toolchain in-place. To do this, run `npm run build:bundles`, afterwards find your bundled files in `dist/bundle/`.
Bundles are not built by default and are not included in the NPM package, we recommend everyone to consume the library through NPM and webpack.

## Debugging Golden Layout library

The `apitest` app can be used to debug the Golden Layout library.  Its `webpack` configuration will import the Golden Layout library source map, allowing debuggers to step through the library source code and place break points.

If you wish to test the library with other applications, you can link to the Golden Layout repository without having to install it into the application from NPM.  This is done with the `npm link` command.  Use the following steps:
1. Run the `npm link` from a shell in the golden-layout source repository top level folder.
1. Run `npm link golden-layout` from a shell in your application's top level folder.

Your application will then use the distribution in the Golden Layout repository `dist` subfolder. If you wish to make changes to the Golden Layout library, you will need to run the `build:api` to regenerate the `dist` folder.

Run `npm install` to remove the npm link.

# Learn

The following information sources are available which can be used to learn how to use Golden Layout:

* **[Version 1 Golden Layout website](https://golden-layout.com)**\
[https://golden-layout.com](https://golden-layout.com) documents version 1 of Golden Layout. While substantial changes were made in version 2, this website can still be used to gain an initial understanding of Golden Layout.
* **This readme**
* **CodePen examples**
    * [**Adding items to a predefined layout**](https://codepen.io/pbklink/pen/dyWJNNm)\
    A basic example showing how Golden Layout is set up and how to add a new item to a layout.

# Description

## Structure

The structure of a Golden Layout object consists of its `LayoutManager` object and `ContentItem` objects which define the layout itself.  See [Structure](./structure/index.md) for more details.

## Binding Components

Golden Layout binds to components and then controls their position, size and visibility (positioning) so that they fit within a layout. There are several different ways in which Golden Layout can bind to components. The easiest method is to register a component type and then specify that component type in a component's configuration.

See [Binding Components](./binding-components/index.md) for a full description of how Golden Layout component binding works.

## Frameworks

Golden Layout has been designed to work with JavaScript application frameworks such as Angular and Vue. Typically these types of frameworks wrap HTML elements with their own components. Instead of an application being a tree of HTML elements, it is a tree of framework components, each of which wrap an HTML element.

To support these frameworks, Golden Layout implements 'Virtual Components'. This allows framework components to be embedded within Golden Layout without having to use advanced framework techniques to allow the relevant framework component HTML elements to be displayed in a layout.

See [Frameworks](./frameworks/index.md) for a description and examples covering how to use Golden Layout with JavaScript application frameworks.

## Sizing components

Within a layout structure, it is necessary to specify the size of `RowOrColumn` content items and their children.  [More](./sizing-components/index.md).

## Layout resizing

A layout should normally resize to always fit within Golden Layout's container element.  This resizing can be configured to occur automatically or can be manually managed. [More](./layout-resizing/index.md)

## Component Focus

Components can have focus. This is analagous to HTML elements having focus. Only one component can have focus at any time. [More](./component-focus/index.md)

## Location Selectors

LocationSelectors specify the location of a component in terms of a parent and a index. They can be used when adding components programatically.  [More](./location-selectors/index.md)

## Header and Buttons

Some [notes](./headers-and-buttons/index.md) regarding headers and buttons.

## Popouts

A component in a layout can be 'popped' out into a separate browser window.  It can be then be viewed separately from the main layout. [More](./popouts/index.md)

# Migration from previous versions

## Upgrading to Version 2

With version 2, Golden Layout was ported to TypeScript. Substantial changes to its feature set and API were made as part of this conversion. These changes are summarised [here](./version-2/index.md).
